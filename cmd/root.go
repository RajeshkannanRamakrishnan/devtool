It provides a collection of utilities including:

  - kill: Terminate processes by PID or Port
  - md5: Compute MD5 hashes (with optional uppercase support)
  - ports: List and filter processes listening on ports
  - server: Start a static HTTP file server
  - upper: Convert strings to uppercase`,

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
